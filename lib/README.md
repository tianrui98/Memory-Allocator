# Midterm Project

The midterm project is dedicated to implementing and using data structures
for dynamic memory allocation and reclamation.

As before, submit your solution to this assignment by creating a
[tagged release on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/creating-releases)
and providing a link to it on Canvas.

## Building this Project

To build the project and run all the tests, simply execute `make
clean; make` from the command line, and you should be good to go. A
number of failing test reports will indicate missing implementation
parts that you will have to provide.

## Your Tasks

The detailed description of the task setup for the project is given at
the following web page:

https://ilyasergey.net/YSC2229/midterm.html

The described tasks should be implemented in the corresponding templates
files provided in the folder `lib` of the project. Make sure to check
the `*Util.ml` files for helper functions that are already
implemented and feel free to implement more machinery if necessary.

As before portion of this assignmentâ€™s total score is reserved for
better testing. Passing basic functionality tests will reward you with
some points; however you are also expected to write any additional
tests you deem necessary. In the case of this project, make sure that
you cover your functionality extensively with tests, paying attention
to the suggestions in the comments given in the files.

1. Implement the heap allocator module in the file `AllocatorImpl.ml`.
   Consult the module type signature in the file `Allocator.ml`,
   paying attention to the comments. You implementation _must_ ahere
   to this signature. Here are some hints on how to organise your
   implementation:

   * It is up to you how to implement the "heap" strucutre, but you
     absolutely *may not* use OCaml's `ref` type in any capacity. The
     heap structure should internally keep track of "free" memory
     segments; you can use an OCaml list (or lists) of for tracking
     free slots in "memory" arrays.

   * All interaction with the heap by the client applications (e.g.,
     Doubly-Linked Lists) should be done by means of using functions
     from the signature of Allocator module, i.e., without referring
     to the concrete contents of its implementation.

   * Ordinary pointers can be implemented as integers (although the
     clients of the module may not know it).

   * You will have to figure out how to "dispatch" pointers when they
     are dereferenced (via `deref_as_*` functions). That is, you will
     have to determine whether a given pointer p points to another
     pointer, integer, or a string in order to chose the correct
     array. Devise a discipline to discriminate the pointers into
     those three categories based on their value.

   * It is worth investing time into coming up with good memory
     reclamation algorithms, which will determine, where the "next"
     pointer is going to be allocated in the heap, therefore,
     maximising its usage.
    
2. In the file `DoublyLinkedList.ml` implement a DLL structure to
   store pairs of values of type `int` and `string`, corresdpondingly,
   so it would rely on the allocator-provided heap. Make sure to use
   memory reclamation for freeing the heap, when removing list nodes.
   Check theavailable tests for the intended use and don't forget to
   add your own.

3. In the file `Queue.ml` implement the specialised queue structure
   based on doubly-linked lists, implemented via allocators. Check the
   tests for how it can be used, and add your own. Specifically, add a
   tests that constructs a queue and populates/depopulates it in a way
   that the number of element the queue sees during its lifetime is
   larger than the allotted heap's capacity, thereby testing the
   memory reclamation logic.
